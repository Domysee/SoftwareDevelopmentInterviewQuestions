# This is a cureated collection of interview questions an interviewee can ask the interviewer about the company 

Asking questions is not only important for the interviewer, but for the potential employee too. As a software developer, you will most likely get multiple offers. Having asked the right questions during the interviews, will remove a lot of the guesswork when choosing the company. 

This list aims to provide a list of questions that *could* be important to you, and hence make your decision between multiple potential employers easier.  
If you come to the interview with a written list of questions, and take note on the answers, you can make sure you don't forget anything important, and you remember their answers as well!

How do your teams work together? Which tools are you using?  
 
How do you organize teams?

What project management framework do you use? Scrum? Kanban? Extreme Programming? Something else?

How often do you have meetings? Are there any scheduled/standing meetings? 

## Planning

How do you handle errors in planning?  
E.g. if there were some features planned, and now you realize that more time is needed to implement them. Do the developers have to work overtime? Do you cut the scope? Do you simply take more time?

How do you prioritize tasks?

What am I going to work on?

Who makes business decisions? 

Who makes technical decisions?  
These decision-making questions are becoming more and more important the more senior you become. As a lead developer, you wouldn't want to have no power over decision-making - why would they want to hire you at all then?  
Generally speaking, if all decisions are made by one person, it's probably not the best. On the other hand, if all decisions are always made by everyone, what is going to happen if people disagree? Better to clear this up.

How is the work-life balance?  
Do you ensure the work-life balance of employees? How?

Do people work overtime? How often? For what reasons? Is it paid?

Is it a challenging environment?  
Or, if they say "we like to challenge each other", what does it mean?  
Try to dig deeper: is it a healthy challenging and respectful discussions aimed at improvement of the product and the process? Examples may be: "is it the best for the team right now", "is this what our customers want", "how can we improve the process".  
Maybe they mean only technical challenges: "how do we scale this better", "how many requests can we process", or "how to make it work faster on smartphones".  
But sometimes "challenging" can mean there are people who are constantly going to question your professionalism and make you feel bad. "Your code is so bad" or "your designs are ugly" are some gruesome examples.

What level of autonomy am I going to have? What decisions am I allowed to make?

How do you assess people's performance?

## Diversity

How diverse is your team? Do you have a diversity commitment? 
The importance of the question varies depending on which group you belong to.  
But do ask this question if you belong to the majority as well. You will help the minorities by doing so. Also you will help companies to start thinking in the right direction. A well-balanced team will benefit everyone: the business, the team, the majorities and the minorities.

## Miscellaneous

How long do your developers typically stay at the company?  
With this question you can gauge developer satisfaction. The longer they stay, the better.

Why did you invite me to the interview?  
This question is quite powerful because it makes the interviewer think about the good things of you, and so he'll have an easier time remembering them when it comes to decision making.

Which aspects of a developer do you value higher than other companies?  
This is a question that replaces the generic ones like *What soft-skills are you looking for?* or *How would an ideal candidate look like?*. Those questions will most likely generate the default answers, like driven, dedicated, motivated, sociable.  
Asking about differences to other companies reveals how you can stand out.

Looking backwards, what mistakes did you make as a company/department/team, and what did you learn from them?
